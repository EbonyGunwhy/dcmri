        "\n# An exploration of water exchange effects\n\nThis tutorial will explore the effect of water exchange in a standard \ntwo-compartmental tissue using the models in `dcmri.Tissue`.\n\nThe three tissue compartments involved are the blood, interstitium and tissue \ncells. The water exchange effects refer to the transport of water across the \nbarriers between them: **transendothelial** water exchange between blood and \ninterstitium, and **transcytolemmal** water exchange between interstitium and \ntissue cells. The water exchange in the blood compartment between plasma and \nred blood cells is assumed to be in the fast exchange limit. \n\nWater exchange across either of these two barriers can be in the \nfast-exchange limit (F), restricted (R), or there may be no water exchange at \nall (N). Since there are two barriers involved this leads to 3x3=9 possible \nwater exchange regimes. `dcmri.Tissue` denotes these 9 regimes by a \ncombination of the letters F, R and N: the frst letter refers to the water \nexchange across the endothelium, and the second to the water exchange across \nthe cell wall. For instance, 'FR' means fast water exchange (F) across the \nendothelium, and restricted water exchange (R) across the cell wall.\n\nFor regimes with restricted water exchange, the rate of exchange is quantified \nby the permeability-surface area (PS) of water, a quantity in units \nof mL/sec/cm3. `dcmri.Tissue` uses the notation ``PSe`` for the \ntransendothelial water PS and ``PSc`` for the transcytolemmal PS.\n"

The bottom right shows that this does not translate into an \nequilbirum between the tissue compartments because the concentration in the \nblood is diluted by the red blood cells. In this case, since there is no \nwater exchange in the tissue, the magnetization (bottom left) follows the \nprofile of the indicator concentrations exactly. Since magnetization cannot \nexchange, it cannot equilibrate and remains directly proportional to the \nconcentration in the compartment. Notably, the magnization in the tissue \ncells remains constant in this case as no indicator can enter this \ncompartment to modulate it, and no magnetization can be transferred.\n\nNow lets consider the opposite scenario of fast water exchange across both \nbarriers. (*Note*: we could use the FF model here, but for the purposes of \nthis illustration it is more instructive to use RR with very high values \nfor the water permeabilities): \n\n"
