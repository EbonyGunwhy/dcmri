        "\n# An exploration of water exchange effects\n\nThis tutorial will explore the effect of water exchange in a standard two-compartmental tissue with extended Tofts kinetics. Data acquisition is modelled using the steady-state model of a spoiled gradient echo sequence.\n\nThe three tissue compartments involved are the blood, interstitium and tissue cells. The effect of water exchange between blood and interstitium (**transendothelial** water exchange) and between interstitium and tissue cells (**transcytolemmal** water exchange) is separately investigated. The water exchange in the blood compartment, particularly between plasma and red blood cells, is assumed to be in the fast exhange limit throughout. \n"

Without transcytolemmal exchange the extravascular curve lines up with the no-exchange model (middle panel). The first pass is closer to the fast-exchange signal but does not align with it completely as it is partly obscured by already extravasated indicator.\n\n4. When both exchange levels are intermediate (right panel), then the signal is also intermediate between the extremes of fast and no exchange.\n\n**Note** while the effect of water exchange is detectable, it is comparatively small considering the difference between the blue and green curves represent the extremes of zero to maximal levels of water exchange. It is easily verified that changing kinetic parameters such as Ktrans over their entire range (zero to infinity) has a much larger impact on the signal.

While the error may be negligible for practical purposes, it is useful and illustrative to explore its origin further.\n\nAny remaining bias must be due to one or more of the three remaining sources of error: (1) *sampling bias* - temporal undersampling in the data used for training, which at 1.5s creates a small mismatch with the exact (pseudo)continuous signals; (2) *convergence bias* - imperfect convergence of the model training; (3) *numerical bias* - numerical errors in the computation of the model solutions. \n\nWe can get some insight by fitting the data with an unbiased model, i.e. fitting the data with the same model that was used to generate it. This is a simple model that is likely to be much less susceptible to convergence or numerical bias, so this analysis exposes the sampling bias (alternatively we can generate data with much smaller temporal sampling intervals):\n\n"

Indeed - reducing the xtolerance and increasing the maximum number of iterations leads to increasingly accurate results.\n\nNumerical error may also play a role, since the general water exchange model is implemented using linear algebra involving operations such as matrix exponentials and numerical matrix inversion, which are likely to come with some numerical error.
