========================================
An exploration of water exchange effects
========================================

This tutorial will explore the effect of water exchange in a standard 
two-compartmental tissue using the models in `dcmri.Tissue`.

The three tissue compartments involved are the blood, interstitium and tissue 
cells. The water exchange effects refer to the transport of water across the 
barriers between them: **transendothelial** water exchange between blood and 
interstitium, and **transcytolemmal** water exchange between interstitium and 
tissue cells. The water exchange in the blood compartment between plasma and 
red blood cells is assumed to be in the fast exchange limit. 

Water exchange across either of these two barriers can be in the 
fast-exchange limit (F), restricted (R), or there may be no water exchange at 
all (N). Since there are two barriers involved this leads to 3x3=9 possible 
water exchange regimes. `dcmri.Tissue` denotes these 9 regimes by a 
combination of the letters F, R and N: the frst letter refers to the water 
exchange across the endothelium, and the second to the water exchange across 
the cell wall. For instance, 'FR' means fast water exchange (F) across the 
endothelium, and restricted water exchange (R) across the cell wall.

For regimes with restricted water exchange, the rate of exchange is quantified 
by the permeability-surface area (PS) of water, a quantity in units 
of mL/sec/cm3. `dcmri.Tissue` uses the notation ``PSe`` for the 
transendothelial water PS and ``PSc`` for the transcytolemmal PS.

We set up the simulation by importing the necessary packages and defining 
the constants that will be fixed throughout.

The role of water exchange
----------------------------
To show how water exchange is relevant in DC-MRI analysis, it is insightful 
to first consider the extreme ends of the water exchange spectrum in some 
more detail: fast water exchange (F) and no water exchange (N). 

Let's first generate a tissue without water exchange across either barrier 
(NN), and plot the signals:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-66

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_nn = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=0, PSc=0, **aif)
    tissue_nn.plot()

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-83

The top right shows that indicator concentrations in plasma and interstitium 
equilibrate at around 3 minutes due to the indicator exchange across the 
capillary wall. The bottom right shows that this does not translate into an 
equilbirum between the tissue compartments because the concentration in the 
blood is diluted by the red blood cells. In this case, since there is no 
water exchange in the tissue, the magnetization (bottom left) follows the 
profile of the indicator concentrations exactly. Since magnetization cannot 
exchange, it cannot equilibrate and remains directly proportional to the 
concentration in the compartment. Notably, the magnization in the tissue 
cells remains constant in this case as no indicator can enter this 
compartment to modulate it, and no magnetization can be transferred.

Now lets consider the opposite scenario of fast water exchange across both 
barriers. (*Note*: we could use the FF model here, but for the purposes of 
this illustration it is more instructive to use RR with very high values 
for the water permeabilities): 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-87

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_ff = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=1e3, PSc=1e3, **aif)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-97

The indicator concentration in the tissue compartments is not affected by 
the level of water exchange (top and bottom right), but the magnetization 
in all 3 compartments is now effectively the same. Even the tissue cells, 
which receive no indicator at all, show the same signal changes over time 
as the intersitium and blood compartments. This is because, with very high 
levels of water exchange, the magnetization between all 3 compartments mixes 
so rapidly that any differences are levelled out instance. The tissue is 
well-mixed for water (and therefore water magnetization), although it is not 
well-mixed for indicator.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-102

Now let's consider the cases where one of the barriers is highly permeable 
for water, and the other is impermeable. First let's look at the case of 
high transendothelial water exchange and no transcytolemmal water exchange:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-106

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_fn = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=1e3, PSc=0, **aif)
    tissue_fn.plot()

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-110

As expected, blood and interstitium have the same magnetization throughout 
and the magnetization of tissue cells is not altered at all. The opposite 
case is similar:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-114

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_nf = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=0, PSc=1e3, **aif)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-117

In this case the tissue cells recieve the same magnetization as the 
interstitium.

Water exchange effect on the MR signal
--------------------------------------

From a measurement perspective, the important question is to what extent 
water exchange across either barrier affects the measured signal, shown in 
the top left corner of the plots above. 

To illustrate the signal differences in more detail, we plot signals in 
mixed exchange regimes against the extremes of fast and no exchange. For 
reference we also include a tissue with intermediate water exchange: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-164

.. code-block:: Python


    # Build a tissue in an intermediate water exchange regime
    tissue_rr = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=1, PSc=2, **aif)

    # Generate signals in all regimes
    signal_ff = tissue_ff.signal()
    signal_nn = tissue_nn.signal()
    signal_fn = tissue_fn.signal()
    signal_nf = tissue_nf.signal()
    signal_rr = tissue_rr.signal()

    # Plot signals against extremes

    ax[0].set_title("""No transendothelial exchange \n

    ax[2].set_title("""Restricted transendothelial exchange \n

These figures show clear that water exchange levels have a measureable 
effect on signals, and at all times lie between the extrements of no water 
exchange (blue) and fast water exchange (green). 

However, while the effect of water exchange is detectable, it is 
comparatively small considering the difference between the blue and green 
curves represent the extremes. By contrast, changing the exchange rate of 
the indicator between its extremes of no- and infinite indicator exchange 
has a more significant impact on the signal:

Water exchange bias
-------------------
As shown above, water exchange is to some extent a second order effect 
compared to indicator exchange. Nevertheless, making inaccurate assumptions 
regarding the level of water exchange can lead to large biases in the other 
measured parameters.

One way to explore the scale of this water exchange bias is by training a 
tissue that has no water exchange (NN) using data generated by a tissue in 
fast water exchange:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 204-215

.. code-block:: Python


    # Generate a NN tissue 
    tissue_nn = dc.Tissue('2CX','NN', **aif)

    # Save the ground truth values 
    truth = tissue_nn.get_params('vp','vi','Ktrans')

    # Train the tissue on the fast-exchange signal and plot results
    tissue_nn.train(t, signal_ff)
    tissue_nn.plot(t, signal_ff)

The plot shows that the no-exchange tissue predicts the data with high 
accuracy. However, the reconstructed magnetization is incorrect for fast 
exchange tissue, and the reconstructed parameters are severely biased:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 219-226

    print('vp error:', round(100*(rec[0]-truth[0])/truth[0],1), '%')
    print('vi error:', round(100*(rec[1]-truth[1])/truth[1],1), '%')

Removing water exchange bias
----------------------------
Water exchange forms a dangerous source of measurement error because it 
cannot be detected by comparing the fit to the data. In ideal circumstances, 
it can be removed by generalizing the model to allow for any level of water 
exchange. Let's try this and look at the results again:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 233-239

.. code-block:: Python


    # Train an RR tissue and plot again
    tissue = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', **aif)
    tissue.train(t, signal_ff, xtol=1e-3)
    tissue.plot(t, signal_ff)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 240-243

Plotting the results now show a practically perfect fit to the data, and the 
magnetization is close to the fast exchange limit. Also the measurements of 
the kinetic parameters are more accurate:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 243-249

.. code-block:: Python


    rec = tissue.get_params('vp','vi','Ktrans')
    print('vp error:', round(100*(rec[0]-truth[0])/truth[0],1), '%')
    print('vi error:', round(100*(rec[1]-truth[1])/-truth[1],1), '%')
    print('Ktrans error:', round(100*(rec[2]-truth[2])/truth[2],1), '%')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    vp error: -0.0 %
    vi error: -0.1 %
    Ktrans error: -0.1 %




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 250-254

As a bonus the water-exchange sensitive model also estimates the water 
permeability. While a numerical fit will not produce the accurate result of 
infinite water PS, this nevertheless produces values that correspond to 
extremely high levels of water exchange: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 254-259

.. code-block:: Python


    rec = tissue.get_params('PSe', 'PSc', round_to=0)
    print('PSe:', rec[0], 'mL/sec/cm3')
    print('PSc:', rec[1], 'mL/sec/cm3')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    PSe: 381.0 mL/sec/cm3
    PSc: 502.0 mL/sec/cm3




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-265

While the errors in kinetic parameters have reduced with this more general 
model, they have not vanished. This is because convergence to a solution 
with infinite water PS is slow. When water exchange rates are high, the data 
should be analysed with a fast water exchange model. We can verify that this 
recovers the accurate results in this case: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 265-270

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue = dc.Tissue('2CX','FF', **aif) 
    tissue.train(t, signal_ff)
    tissue.plot(t, signal_ff)

The tissue now predicts the data correctly and the kinetic parameters are 
recovered exactly:

Handling water exchange
-----------------------
The above example suggests one strategy of removing water exchange bias, 
i.e. include water exchange rates as free parameters and get the added 
benefit of a water exchange measurement. However this may not always be the 
right approach. The data in this tutorial are noise-free, and therefore even 
very subtle structure can be exploited to estimate parameters. In noisy data 
this may not be the case, and one may well be forced to fix parameters that 
have a relatively small effect on the data in order to improve the precision 
in others. 

This raises the question where any of the regimes of fast and zero water 
exchange offers a good approximation to real tissues. For this exercise we 
will assume values on the upper end of literature data, and set PSe and PSc 
to 0.05 mL/sec/cm3. We plot the resulting signal against the extremes of 
fast and no exchange:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 296-315

.. code-block:: Python


    # Generate tissue
    tissue = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=0.05, PSc=0.5, **aif)
    tissue_nn = dc.Tissue('2CX','NN',**aif)
    tissue_ff = dc.Tissue('2CX','FF',**aif)

    # Plot signals 
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,5))

    ax.set_title('Realistic water exchange against extremes')
    ax.plot(t, tissue_ff.signal(), 'g-', label='Fast water exchange')
    ax.plot(t, tissue_nn.signal(), 'b-', label='No water exchange')
    ax.plot(t, tissue.signal(), 'r--', label='Realistic water exchange')
    ax.set_xlabel('Time (sec)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Signal (a.u.)')
    ax.legend()

    plt.show()

Considering the water PS values were chosen at the upper end of the 
literature data, this example would suggest that the assumption of no water 
exchange should be close to the truth. However, this may not generalize to 
all conditions. The impact of water exchange depends on the imaging 
sequence, which can be optimized to maximize water exchange sensitivity.
