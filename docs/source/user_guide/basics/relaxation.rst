Relaxation
----------

Contrast agents and their concentration are visible in MRI because the agents
are designed to modify the relaxation rates of tissues. This section deals 
with the relationship between contrast agent concentration and magnetic 
relaxation rates.

This part of the modelling is determined by the following parameters:
